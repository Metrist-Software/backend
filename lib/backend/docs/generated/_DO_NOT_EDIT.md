# Generated Doc Outputs

All modules in this folder are automatically generated and should not be manually
edited. Any changes made here are highly likely to be overwritten the next time
the generation task is run.

Data in these modules are sourced from the manifests found in the [monitors](https://github.com/Metrist-Software/monitors)
repo and built using the [metrist.generate_manifest_docs](../../../mix//tasks//metrist/generate_manifest_docs.ex)
mix task

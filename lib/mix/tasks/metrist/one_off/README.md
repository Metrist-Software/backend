# One-off Mix tasks

This directory is for one-off Mix tasks. These typically are the result of a ticket needing roll-out
steps that are easiest accomplish by manually invoking the tasks.

Adding these mix tasks is fine.

Maintaining them: not so much.

Therefore, assume that the tasks here are broken: they use obsolete methods to interact with our backend, they
invoke methods that don't exist, and so on. We keep them around just in case we need them for inspiration,
but that's all.
